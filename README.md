# SegResNet-based-Reciprocal-Transformation
We used the BONBID-HIE 2023 dataset to train our model. You can download the dataset from the link(https://zenodo.org/record/8104103). You can get access to our pre-trained model from the link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BloHARABfrl7qLloK_AXKntPKl6_Wm3-/view?usp=sharing. To train the model you should make your dataset compatible with MONAI dataset format. We provided json_cross_val.py and dataset.json files to show the correct format.
